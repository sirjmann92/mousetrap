## Browser Cookie Setup Card & UI Improvements âœ¨

### **New Browser Cookie Setup Card**
- **Separated browser cookie management from Vault Configuration:**
  - Created dedicated `MAMBrowserSetupCard.jsx` component for browser cookie extraction and validation
  - Renamed from "MAM Browser Cookie Setup" to "Browser Cookie Setup" for clarity
  - Moved bookmarklet, browser cookie input, connection method, and vault access testing to new card
  - Vault Configuration card now focuses solely on donation settings and automation
- **React 19 bookmarklet compatibility fix:**
  - Fixed bookmarklet drag-to-bookmark functionality broken by React 19 security changes
  - Implemented callback ref pattern: `ref={(node) => { if (node) node.setAttribute('href', code); }}`
  - Sets `href` immediately when element is created, bypassing React's security blocking of `javascript:` URLs
  - Works with React 19's stricter security model without compromising functionality

### **Notification Card Enhancements**
- **Visual notification method indicators:**
  - Added icon-based indicators showing which notification methods are configured
  - Icons displayed on far right of card header, clickable to expand card and Configuration accordion
  - Uses official brand logos from Wikimedia Commons for Gmail and Discord (proper licensing and consistency)
- **Icon implementations:**
  - **Gmail:** Multicolor "M" logo SVG from Wikimedia Commons (automatically detected when SMTP host contains "gmail")
  - **Discord:** Official blurple game controller logo SVG from Wikimedia Commons (for Discord webhooks)
  - **Email:** Material-UI EmailIcon in blue (#4285F4) for non-Gmail SMTP
  - **Webhook:** Material-UI WebhookIcon in red (#FF6B6B) for generic webhooks
  - **Apprise:** Font Awesome bullhorn icon in orange (#FFA726) - no official logo available
- **Removed info tooltip:** Cleaned up card header by removing redundant info icon tooltip
- **Smart detection:** Checks actual configuration fields (smtp.host, webhook_url, apprise.url) not event rules

### **Perk Automation Card Improvements**
- **Vault currency display:**
  - Added Wedges and Cheese counters next to Points display in card header
  - Fetches from associated vault configuration (prefers matching session, falls back to first available)
  - Displays as: `Points: 12,345 | Wedges: 678 | Cheese: 901` with green success color
  - Currency values shown only when available and not loading

### **Component Organization**
- **Card reordering for better workflow:**
  1. Session Status
  2. Session Configuration
  3. Perk Purchase & Automation
  4. Millionaire's Vault Configuration
  5. **Notifications** (moved up from position 8)
  6. **Browser Cookie Setup** (new card, position 6)
  7. Docker Port Monitor
  8. Proxy Configuration
- **Parent state management:**
  - `vaultConfigurations` now managed in `App.jsx` and passed to child components
  - Added `onConfigUpdate` callback for child components to trigger parent refresh
  - Prevents stale data and unnecessary API calls

### **Technical Details**
- Added Font Awesome 6.5.1 CDN to `index.html` for Apprise bullhorn icon
- Inline SVG components for Gmail and Discord logos (no external dependencies)
- Callback ref pattern bypasses React 19's `href` security: sets attribute after render but before React's security check
- Bookmarklet extracts `mam_id`, `uid`, and browser type in one click

## Vault Donation Success Detection Fix ðŸ”§

### **Bug Fixes**
- **Fixed vault donation success detection race condition:**
  - Added 2-second delay after donation POST before checking points balance
  - Prevents false "no success confirmation" errors when MAM backend processes donation slowly
  - Affects both direct and proxy donation methods
  - Race condition occurred when points verification happened before MAM's database updated

### **Improved Vault Donation Logging**
- **Enhanced points verification logging:**
  - Changed verification logs from DEBUG to INFO level for better visibility
  - Added actual delta calculation: shows exact point change vs expected change
  - Improved error messages with detailed point comparison data
  - Format: `Points before: X, Current: Y, Expected: Z, Actual delta: W`
- **Better failure diagnostics:**
  - Error messages now include point deltas when verification fails
  - Shows tolerance threshold (100 points) in warning messages
  - Helps identify whether donation actually succeeded but verification had timing issues

### **Technical Details**
- Added `await asyncio.sleep(2)` after donation POST in both `_perform_vault_donation_direct()` and `_perform_vault_donation_proxy()`
- Improved error message from generic "Donation not processed - no success confirmation received" to more detailed "Donation may have failed - no success confirmation in response and points verification inconclusive (points before: X, after: Y, expected: Z)"
- All three verification paths updated: session-based, browser-based, and proxy-based

  - Partial input: CLEAR enabled, SAVE PROXY disabled
  - All required fields filled (label, host, port): Both buttons enabled
  - Prevents invalid proxy saves and improves UX clarity

### **Backend Data Structure Updates**
- **vault_config.py:** 
  - Added `get_vault_configuration()` field merging for backward compatibility
  - Default pot_tracking schema includes `last_donation_amount` and `last_donation_type`
- **millionaires_vault_automation.py:** Updated to pass donation details to `update_pot_tracking()`

## Major Changes

- **Unified Docker Port Monitoring:**
  - All port monitoring logic is now unified under a single backend/API. Legacy/duplicate code removed.
  - `/api/port-monitor/containers` endpoint provides a live Docker container list for the UI.
  - Manual public IPs: If a user enters a manual IP, the system will pause auto-restarts and notify the user after 3 consecutive unreachable checks. A warning is shown in the UI/event log until the user updates/disables the manual IP.
  - After restarting a primary container, the system waits up to 60s for the port to be reachable. If not, but the container is running, it proceeds to restart secondaries and notifies the user. If not running, secondaries are not restarted and the user is notified.
  - All port monitoring actions (checks, restarts, failures, manual IP pauses) are logged to the UI event log and backend logs.
  - If Docker socket permissions are missing, port monitoring is disabled and a warning is shown in the UI.
  - The `DOCKER_GID` environment variable can be set to match your host's Docker group GID for proper Docker socket access. See README for details.

## Other Improvements
- Improved event log clarity and error reporting for all automation types.
- Documentation scrubbed of real IDs, usernames, IPs, ASNs, and other personal data.
- All documentation and changelogs updated for new port monitoring workflow and environment variable usage.

## Late August 2025

### New Features & Fixes
- **Upload Credit Automation:**
  - Added backend automation for upload credit purchases, supporting both point-based and time-based triggers.
  - UI and backend now support all three automation types: Wedge, VIP, and Upload Credit.
- **Integer Guardrails:**
  - All automation logic now safely handles None values for points and thresholds, preventing comparison errors and automation crashes.
- **VIP Duration Label:**
  - The VIP purchase dropdown label in the UI is now "VIP Duration" for clarity.
- **Bugfixes:**
  - Fixed rare automation errors when points or thresholds were None.
  - Improved event log clarity and error reporting for all automation types.
